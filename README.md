Welcome to the **VSWIR Imaging and Thermal Applications, Learning, and Science** Repository! This repository provides Python Jupyter notebooks to help users work with visible to short-wave infrared imaging spectroscopy data, thermal infrared data, and other products from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission, ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission, and others. 

> **2025 VSWIR-TIR Fundamentals to use Hyperspectral and Thermal NASA Earth Observations Workshop**  
>
> Please view the [web-book](https://nasa.github.io/VITALS/) for workshop details.
